## Digit classification using CNN model
Trained Mnist dataset using a CNN based model to classify and recognize digits. Tried with different architectures (variations of Lenet - Varying Conv2d or maxpooling or acivation layers), loss functions, adding batch normalization, regularization (droputs or l2 regularization) and optimization methods (adam optimizer). Best accuracy of around 97.2% was obtained
