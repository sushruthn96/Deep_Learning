## Mnist with CNN learning
Trained Mnist dataset using a CNN based model. Tried with different architectures (variations of Lenet - Varying Conv2d or maxpooling or acivation layers), loss functions, adding batch normalization, regularization (droputs or l2 regularization) and optimization methods (adam optimizer). The best result obtained was 97.2% prediction accuracy.
